Pretalx is a conference planning tool focused on providing the best experience for organisers, speakers, reviewers, and attendees alike. It handles the submission process with a configurable Call for Participation, the reviewing and selection of submissions, and the scheduling and release handling. After the event, pretalx allows speakers to receive feedback, upload their slides, and organisers to embed recordings.
